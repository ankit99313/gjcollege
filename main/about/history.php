          It is not easier to speak literal explanation of this wise saying of
          the aforesaid mystical saint. But in the light of his perceptive
          intellect it may be construed that nothing is possible without
          acquiring sufficiency and efficiency in the field of knowledge. It has
          been observed particularly since the remote antiquity that the name
          and fame earned by accumulating huge wealth or the post and position
          however high held by accumulating huge wealth or the post and position
          however high held by applying all sorts of tactics, trickery,
          maneuvering and manipulations do not provide such brightness, glory
          and gloss to any individual family or society as only education does.
          <br />
          <br />
          Keeping this fact in mind, after the attainment of independence. It
          was felt that the education that helped to create to awareness during
          national movement for liberty could also help to achieve freedom from
          fear, want, diseases, ignorance, squalor and elimination of poverty by
          the application and development of knowledge. With the passage of time
          and all that came and went with it, the achievement of knowledge
          through meditation or penances lost their relevance. During nearly two
          centuries of British dominion and introduction of Macaley system, the
          significance of knowledge had changed from value to price. To acquire
          knowledge meant achieve it through academic institutions like schools,
          colleges and universities. Under such circumstances, an institution
          for higher education in Bihta a rural area of Patna district was
          assumed to be the need of the hour that may provide an opportunity to
          reflect on the critical , social, economical, cultural, moral and
          spiritual issues facing the rural masses of all categories. It was
          further felt, a college, if established will stand for humanism,
          increase in tolerance with reasoning, adventure of idea, search of
          truth thereby providing quality of leadership in politics,
          administration, profession, trade, commerce and industry.

          With this mission in mind, Pram Pujya Sri GADADHARACHARYA alias MACHA
          BABA conceived the idea to start a college to impart education to the
          children of the poor people of this rural area. His brain child was
          translated on the ground with the help of local people in the form of
          Sri Gadadharachaya Janta College, Rambagh, Bihta (Patna) now popularly
          know as G. J. College, Rambagh, Bihta (Patna) as a proposed college in
          1958. It got affiliation on 21st June 1959 up to B.A. by then Bihar
          University. It got permanent affiliation upto B.A . in 1965 by Magadh
          University, Gaya under the stewardship of Late Awadhesh Kumar Sinha as
          the Principal of the college. This college got permission to start
          Hons. in Economics, Pol. Sc. and then in Hindi.
          <br />
          <br />
          Science education was started from 1969 in Phy, Chem, and Maths and
          from 1970 in Biology (Zoo. &amp; Bot.). This college got permanent
          affiliation in Science from 1974-75. On 1st April 1977 this college
          became a constituent unit of Magadh University, Bodh Gaya.
          <br />
          <br />
          The dream of its founder MACHA BABA has became a reality as this
          college is imparting degree level education in Arts and Science up to
          Hons. to the rural population of this area. This college has completed
          50 years and in this Golden Jubilee year it is going to add one more
          feather to its cap by starting B. Com. Hons., teaching from the
          academic session 2009-10 which is the need of changing world.
